# Optical Mark Recognition 
This project utilizes OpenCV in Python to revolutionize the grading process for multiple-choice answer sheets. The system incorporates a camera for seamless image capture, eliminating the need for traditional scanning devices and enhancing accessibility.  Its Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) feature precisely identifies and interprets marked bubbles, while a sophisticated grading algorithm automates the scoring process based on a predefined answer key. This not only reduces the potential for human error but also significantly expedites the grading process, offering a faster turnaround for any kind of assessment results.

**Tech Stach used**
For frontend, we have used Flutter as we are making an app and for backend, python has been used.
To process the image, OMR is used; mose specifically OpenCV
