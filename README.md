**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
Revolutionize multiple-choice grading with OpenCV in Python. Our system, using a camera for image capture, eliminates traditional scanners for seamless accessibility. The Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) feature interprets bubbles accurately, while a smart grading algorithm reduces errors, expediting results for faster assessments.
